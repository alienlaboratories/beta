# Alien Labs

Alien Labs is an early stage angel-funded technology startup based in Brooklyn, New York. 
We develop core technologies and applications for business professionals.
The company was founded by senior ex-Google engineers with extensive experience developing internet-scale 
applications and infrastructure.


## Vision

Every 5-10 years the software industry goes through radical transitions due the emergence of 
fundamentally new technologies: Client-Server, The Web, Web 2.0 responsive applications, Smart phones, 
The Cloud, and now the beginning of the AI revolution. Today, however, our data is fragmented across 
dozens of different, mostly "passive", applications and services. In effect, we manage these disparate 
services, rather than having these systems work for us.

Our platform &mdash; Nexus &mdash; is a secure machine learning framework and intelligent assistant 
for business professionals.

Nexus automatically organizes your information (messages, calendars, documents, tasks, web and database resources) 
so that the most important and relevant information is readily accessible based on your current task or activity. 
Nexus also provides insights and background research on things that are important to you. 
Nexus works with your existing applications and adapts intelligently to your individual, 
team and organizational workflows.
